//
// MERGE NOTE (V4.15.0): the prior V4.14.0 revision of this file was written
// from a project handoff synthesis without access to the actual bench-tested
// firmware, and explicitly flagged its own NS12 wire-protocol implementation
// and 38400-baud claim as unverified ("diff this against whatever is
// actually on disk... before flashing to real hardware"). That protocol
// layer has been replaced here with the one from the actual bench-tested
// HotMelt_MLX90640_80032_9_8_1.cpp snapshot, which documents specific,
// falsifiable bench results (9600 baud measured zero RM timeouts vs ~15% at
// 38400; the ESC=0x1B-for-WM quirk found via live sensor data and a test
// pattern both landing correctly on the physical screen). Where the two
// files disagreed, the version with documented bench evidence won. Board
// diagnostics (I2C scanner, board info), camera-recovery-on-repeated-
// failure, real windowed FPS measurement, an RGB status LED, an ESP task
// watchdog, and the $W0-$W8 telemetry block were all restored from that
// same bench-tested file -- V4.14.0 had dropped them.
//
// Kept from V4.14.0 (real forward progress, not present in the older
// snapshot): encoder position tracking (PCNT), Keyence IV2 trigger/result
// handling, tube presence sensor edge detection, forward-projection tube
// timing, per-strip (strip1/strip2) glue QC evaluation, velocity-adaptive
// HMI display throttling, and the column-paced experimental 32x24 HMI mode
// with an RM-success-rate auto-fallback (whose pacing interval and read
// path are both fixed here -- see the NS12 namespace and NS12Manager).
//
// STILL UNVERIFIED ON REAL HARDWARE: this merge has not itself been bench
// tested. Re-verify the NS12 link (baud, ESC byte, frame framing) and the
// Action-Item placeholder pins below before flashing to the real machine.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (2026-09): a real run of the archived reference file
// (reference/HotMelt_MLX90640_80032_9_8_1.cpp, not this file) surfaced two
// bugs this file inherited by porting that file's logic verbatim:
//   1. RM reads: 0/2968 succeeded on real hardware -- the "confirmed
//      working" claim for non-blocking RM reads was apparently never true
//      for the response-parsing path specifically. parseRmResponse() now
//      dumps the raw rejected bytes on every failure (unconditionally, not
//      gated by a debug flag) so the real response framing can finally be
//      read off directly instead of guessed at a third time.
//   2. Maximum temp reported 782.23C against a 15.71-24.21C frame -- one
//      glitching pixel, unfiltered, became "maximum temp" and would have
//      force-triggered a false QC capture (CAPTURE_TRIGGER_TEMP_C=180C).
//      isPlausibleTemp() (-40C..300C) now gates every pixel used for
//      statistics, the HMI downsample, and the capture trigger/composite/
//      strip evaluation -- see calculateFrameStatistics(), downsampleMaxBlock(),
//      and CaptureController below.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.1, this file's own first run): confirmed the
// isPlausibleTemp() fix above holds on real hardware (Implausible pixels: 0,
// sane 20-50C range every report). The RM parse-failure dump then caught
// this file's OWN reads failing too: raw response "ESC WM001F" every time,
// identically -- shaped like our own WM-write signature ('W','M'), not an
// RM reply ('R','M'), so the two-offset guess in parseRmResponse() was
// never the actual bug. NS12Manager::service() now defers the telemetry
// WM write (and serviceDisplayThrottle()/serviceMatrixPacing() defer their
// matrix writes) while an RM read is pending, since RM_READ_TIMEOUT_MS and
// TELEMETRY_WRITE_INTERVAL_MS are close enough (250-300ms) that a write
// could otherwise land mid-read on this shared UART. If the same bogus
// response still appears after this, it points at a genuine hardware
// TX/RX loopback or PT echo rather than a timing overlap -- check wiring.
//
// Also fixed in V4.15.1, unrelated to NS12: a real boot showed
// "Detected size(4096k) smaller than the size in the binary image
// header(8192k)" and a fatal do_core_init assert on every startup --
// platformio.ini's generic devkit board defaulted to 8MB flash against
// this chip's real 4MB (ESP32-S3FH4R2 = Flash 4MB / PSRAM 2MB Quad).
// Fixed in platformio.ini, not in this file.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.2): NS12 write traffic confirmed alive on a scope,
// and separately confirmed the "no Serial output" problem reproduces even
// on the archived reference file with a completely different .cpp, which
// rules out application code as the cause -- it's a build-config issue
// (native USB CDC not enabled), fixed in platformio.ini alongside the
// flash-size fix, not yet verified on hardware.
//
// Also V4.15.2: added (not yet wired into acquisition) placeholder
// constants for a raw-ADC-delta HMI path -- see MATRIX_RAW_DELTA_MIN/MAX
// and CAPTURE_TRIGGER_RAW_DELTA below. Intent: the HMI only shows 10
// colors, so running full per-pixel MLX90640 calibration every frame to
// throw away that precision is wasted CPU time; a raw read + per-pixel
// baseline subtraction + linear map straight to a palette index is
// intended to replace it for a faster response. Blocked on the actual
// getRawFrame() signature from this project's vendored library fork
// (not the standard Adafruit_MLX90640 API) before the real acquisition
// path and the two-subpage-to-32x24 combination can be written --
// guessing that part risks a silently checkerboard-corrupted image
// rather than a compile error, so it isn't attempted here yet.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.3): got the vendored library's actual source
// (Adafruit_MLX90640.h/.cpp + utility/MLX90640_API.cpp). getRawFrame()
// itself turned out to just call the private MLX90640_GetFrameData()
// twice -- it does NOT resolve subpage-to-pixel mapping for the caller;
// that lives inside the private MLX90640_CalculateTo(). Pulled the real
// formula from that function rather than guessing:
//   row = pixelNumber/32, col = pixelNumber%32
//   chessPattern = (row%2) ^ (col%2)
// A pixel's data is in whichever of the two raw reads has
// frameData[833] (embedded subpage index) == that pixel's chessPattern
// -- getRawFrame() doesn't guarantee frameData0 is always subpage 0, so
// both reads are checked per pixel, not assumed. Verified against the
// actual driver source, not assumed from general MLX90640 knowledge.
//
// The raw-ADC-delta path is now fully wired into the main acquisition
// loop: readMlxRawCombined() (the verified combine above) + rawBaseline
// (captured via 'B', averaging RAW_BASELINE_FRAME_COUNT idle frames) +
// tempToPaletteIndex() against MATRIX_RAW_DELTA_MIN/MAX. mlx.getFrame()
// is no longer called every frame -- only on demand by 'X', for a one-
// off calibrated-C snapshot printed alongside the raw-delta dump, to
// help correlate real thresholds. MATRIX_TEMP_MIN_C/MAX_C and
// CAPTURE_TRIGGER_TEMP_C are unused by the live path now but kept for
// reference. Not yet bench-verified: the two RAW_DELTA placeholder
// values, and the chess-pattern combine logic above (correct by
// inspection of the real driver source, but not yet cross-checked
// against a real image on hardware).
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.4): with the previous update's write/read overlap
// fix in place, RM went from 100% parse failures ("WM001F" bleeding in
// from writes) to 117/117 clean timeouts -- zero responses, not
// malformed ones. Conclusion: this PT does not answer RM requests in
// this configuration at all; it was never a framing or timing bug.
// Since RM isn't load-bearing for the live 16x8 path (only the
// currently-off experimental 32x24 auto-fallback needs it), and every
// attempt now guarantees paying its full 250ms timeout (during which
// telemetry/matrix writes are deferred) for zero benefit, the periodic
// RM test read is now disabled by default -- see
// NS12_ENABLE_RM_TEST_READ in the NS12 namespace.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.5): first full real-hardware run of the raw-delta
// pipeline end to end -- confirmed working correctly, not just compiling.
// Decoded a live telemetry WM frame by hand and every field matched the
// Serial diagnostics panel exactly (fps, state, status bits). Baseline
// recapture correctly freezes stats rather than showing garbage while in
// progress (calculateFrameStatistics()/capture.onNewFrame() are gated
// behind !rawBaselineCaptureInProgress in loop()). Idle raw delta sits
// within +/-75 of baseline, comfortably under CAPTURE_TRIGGER_RAW_DELTA
// (300) -- no false trigger at rest. NS12 WM attempts now climb at the
// full undeferred 4/sec telemetry rate, confirming the V4.15.4 RM-disable
// actually recovered that throughput. Only change this version: the
// "Raw baseline: CAPTURED -- capturing now..." diagnostics line read as
// contradictory (technically accurate -- the previous baseline stays in
// use until a recapture completes -- but confusing) and is now one
// unambiguous message instead of two concatenated ones.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.6): root-caused "'M' shows nothing on the PT" from
// the actual captured wire bytes ("WM002BC121,2,3,...") rather than
// guessing again at capture-state gating. Address 02BC(=700) decoded
// correctly, but the count field read "12" while 128 comma-separated
// values followed -- the NS12 wire protocol's LL field is exactly 2
// decimal digits (*L(2 dec)), so the default 16x8 mode's one-shot
// 128-word burst was never a legal frame in the first place, and
// writeDecimal2()'s 2-byte tmp buffer silently truncated "128" to "12"
// instead of erroring. The PT was told to expect 12 words while 128
// followed and never rendered anything -- explains every prior "screen
// shows nothing" report for the default (non-experimental) matrix mode.
// Fixed at the architecture level: pushWordLampMatrix() now always
// column-paces (rows=8 or 24 words per WM command, both well under the
// 99-word protocol ceiling), for both 16x8 and 32x24, never a single
// cols*rows burst. MAX_WM_WORDS corrected from 128 (wrong -- that was
// the bug, not a real limit) to 99 (the actual protocol ceiling), with a
// defensive clamp + counted wmOversizedCount if anything ever requests
// more, so a regression here is visible in diagnostics instead of
// silently corrupting the frame again.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.7): confirmed none of ENCODER_PULSE_PIN,
// PRESENCE_SENSOR_PIN, KEYENCE_TRIGGER_PIN, KEYENCE_RESULT_PIN are
// physically wired yet (Action Item 1 still open). The two CHANGE-
// interrupt inputs (presence sensor, Keyence result) were configured as
// bare INPUT -- floating, since nothing's connected -- which invites
// noise-triggered spurious interrupts driving handlePresenceEdge()/
// handleKeyenceResult() off phantom edges instead of a real sensor,
// corrupting bench testing of every other subsystem in the meantime.
// Changed both (and the encoder pulse pin, same reasoning, lower
// operational impact) to INPUT_PULLDOWN for a defined idle state.
// Assumed polarity, not confirmed -- revisit once real sensor output
// types are known, per Action Item 1.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.8): replaced the single fixed
// PRESENCE_TO_KEYENCE_DISTANCE_MM with operator-entered HotMelt Start/End
// Position (hotMeltStartPositionMm/hotMeltEndPositionMm), per spec: Start
// is referenced from the tube's leading edge (known immediately), End
// from the trailing edge (only knowable once a tube's length has been
// measured -- so the first tube after a gap gets no End-position check;
// every tube after that uses the previous tube's measured length). Real
// values are meant to come from the HMI via RM (serviceHmiInputPolling(),
// NS12_ENABLE_RM_POLLING) -- currently OFF by default since RM still gets
// zero response from this PT; both positions sit on PLACEHOLDER fallback
// constants until that's resolved. Top suspect for the RM non-response,
// not yet tried: CX-Designer's Memory Link "Response" setting, documented
// OFF in this project's original setup notes -- if that gates ALL PT-
// initiated replies (not just WM-write acknowledgment), it would exactly
// explain WM succeeding at 100% while RM times out at 100%. Try flipping
// it ON and re-downloading the PT project before assuming RM is
// unfixable. Also unconfirmed: the two HOTMELT_*_POSITION_ADDR $W
// addresses (placeholders, never checked against the real CX-Designer
// project) and the HMI numeric input's count-to-mm scale
// (HMI_POSITION_MM_PER_COUNT, assumed 1:1).
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.9): real screenshot of CX-Designer's Comm. Setting
// screen (Serial Port A / Memory Link) rules out the Response=OFF theory
// above -- Response is confirmed ON. But the same screenshot surfaces a
// field this project had never looked at: "Start Communication $W:
// 16384". Reasoned hypothesis, NOT verified against the official Host
// Connection Manual (Cat. No. V085-E1-07) -- every candidate manual/
// documentation host was blocked by this sandbox's network egress
// policy, so this could not be confirmed against primary documentation:
// if that field defines an offset between a $Wn object's CX-Designer
// label and its actual Memory Link wire address, it would explain the
// exact WM-succeeds/RM-never-responds asymmetry seen throughout this
// project. Added NS12::WORD_ADDRESS_OFFSET (default 0, i.e. unchanged
// behavior) applied centrally in sendWM()/requestRM()/consumeReadWord()
// so every $Wn address elsewhere in this file stays written as its plain
// label regardless of the offset setting. Set it to 16384 (and
// NS12_ENABLE_RM_POLLING to 1) to actually test this on real hardware --
// that's a faster, more reliable answer than continuing to reason about
// it without access to the manual.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.10): actually running the V4.15.9 test -- turned
// NS12_ENABLE_RM_POLLING to 1 and, deliberately, split the offset into an
// RM-only constant (NS12::RM_WORD_ADDRESS_OFFSET, set to 16384) instead of
// applying it to WM as well. WM already gets clean transport-level acks at
// its current (unoffset) addresses; there's no evidence WM needs this
// offset, and testing an unverified read-side theory is no reason to risk
// the one path that already works. Next diagnostics capture with this
// build tells the story: NS12 RM attempts/success no longer 0 confirms the
// offset theory (and raises the question of whether WM needs it too, as a
// separate follow-up); still 100% timeout rules it out and this reverts to
// RM_WORD_ADDRESS_OFFSET = 0 pending a new hypothesis.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.10, second fix): field report -- "'M' shows the test
// pattern, but it won't go /reset". Root cause: the live display pipeline
// only ever pushes a fresh composite when a real capture completes
// (CaptureController::onNewFrame() -> requestDisplayPush(), by design, so
// the HMI holds a stable QC-confirmation image instead of flickering live
// video); 'R' only reset CaptureController's internal latch, never touched
// the HMI itself. So any one-shot diagnostic push ('M's test pattern, or in
// principle a real QC image) had no way back to blank except waiting for
// the next real capture. 'R' now also pushes an explicit all-minimum
// (coldest palette bucket) frame, making it an actual visible reset.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.11): the V4.15.10 RM offset test came back from real
// hardware: "112 / 108 / 0 / 0 / 4" (attempts/success/writeFail/timeout/
// parseErr) -- 0 timeouts, 96% success, versus 117/117 clean timeouts
// before. RM_WORD_ADDRESS_OFFSET=16384 is CONFIRMED correct for this PT/
// project, not just a hypothesis anymore. Diagnostics also showed
// "HotMelt Start/End position (mm) : 33.0 / 34.0 (from HMI)" -- real
// operator-entered values, confirming HOTMELT_START_POSITION_ADDR=11 and
// HOTMELT_END_POSITION_ADDR=12 are correct too. Cross-checked against the
// real CX-Designer Symbol Table (project 510_HotMel_20260902_1): confirmed
// no other object is bound to $W11/$W12; used words nearby are $W0-$W5,
// $HW0, $W10, $W500-$W505, $W700+ (matrix) -- so $W13-$W499 and
// $W506-$W699 are free for future host reads, address budget permitting
// (still needs the same real-project check before use, same as $W11/$W12
// did). Also confirmed from that same symbol table: $B (bit), $W (word),
// $HB and $HW (retentive versions) are independent address spaces on this
// PT, not different views onto the same memory -- $W0 (AutoGen2) and $HW0
// (AutoGen8) already coexist at "address 0" with no conflict, and likewise
// $B10/$B20 sit alongside $W10/$W500s. Not yet investigated: the 4/112 RM
// parse errors (doesn't block operation -- a failed read is just skipped
// and retried next poll cycle) and the HMI_POSITION_MM_PER_COUNT=1.0f
// scale assumption (addresses are now confirmed; whether raw HMI counts
// map 1:1 to mm has not been checked against a physical measurement).
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.12): added NS12 bit-level RB (read)/WB (write)
// support, extending the existing single-slot non-blocking read state
// machine (readPending/expectedAddr/etc., previously RM-only) with a
// pendingCmdType tag so it now routes 'M' (word) and 'B' (bit) responses
// to separate counters and separate consumeReadWord()/consumeReadBit()
// pop-once accessors. Used for 5 new HMI push-buttons confirmed from the
// real Symbol Table ($B30-$B34: SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL/TEST/DIAG),
// polled on a faster NS12::BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS (200ms) than the
// position words since a human is watching for the lamp to react.
// TEST/DIAG button presses call the same pushTestPattern()/
// printDiagnostics() the 'M'/'D' serial commands do (factored
// pushTestPattern() out for this); SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL are stub
// handlers (lamp + log only) since no such subsystem exists yet -- needs a
// behavior spec before more goes there. Bit addressing uses a new
// NS12::BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET (16384, reused from the $W offset's own
// screenshot, which separately lists "$B: 16384") applied to BOTH RB and
// WB, unlike the RM/WM split -- there is no already-working $B write to
// protect here, since WB is brand new. UNTESTED as of this writing: the
// offset value for $B, and the entire RB/WB wire format (reasoned by
// analogy to the confirmed WM/RM framing, ESC='W'/'R' + 'B' + '0' + 4-hex
// addr + 2-dec count + data, but never bench-verified). Also PLACEHOLDER:
// the 5 lamp addresses ($B40-$B44) -- no "Button Lamp" objects exist in
// the real Symbol Table yet, so these were picked as the next free block,
// not confirmed. Expect a follow-up FIELD UPDATE once real hardware
// exercises this, the same way RM_WORD_ADDRESS_OFFSET went from
// hypothesis (V4.15.9/10) to confirmed (V4.15.11).
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.13): the V4.15.12 RB/WB build ran on real hardware --
// diagnostics came back "HMI buttons ... : 1/1/1/1/1", all 5 permanently
// "pressed" (only one setActiveLamp() call ever fired, per WB attempts
// staying at exactly BUTTON_COUNT=5 across dumps -- i.e. one 0->1 edge per
// button, then stuck, not flickering). Physically implausible -- no
// operator holds 5 buttons down continuously -- so this is a read/parse
// bug, not real presses. RB success rate (358/511, ~70%) is also
// meaningfully worse than RM's (112/123, ~91%) under the same traffic, and
// raw captures already show stray bytes shaped like our own WM traffic
// bleeding into a pending RB's response ("[ESC]WM001F" -- correctly
// rejected by the pendingCmdType check, but proves collisions are
// frequent at this address/traffic mix). Leading suspects, not yet
// distinguished: (1) genuine PT replies whose bit-value field isn't a
// plain "0"/"1" the way parseReadResponse() assumes, so it's finding SOME
// nonzero value every time even at rest; (2) our own outgoing RB request
// echoing back on this link (as WM traffic already does per the pre-
// V4.15.4 field report) with just enough trailing garbage after it to
// pass the dataLen>0 check, producing a spuriously nonzero "value" from
// noise, consistently rather than randomly. Added a raw-bytes dump on
// parseReadResponse() SUCCESS (mirroring dumpRejectedLine(), which only
// covered failures) so the next hardware run shows exactly what's being
// matched -- that answers which theory is right instead of guessing
// further. Do not trust HMI button state or lamp behavior until that
// capture is reviewed; TEST/DIAG button dispatch stays wired (so it's
// visible when it misfires) but should be treated as unverified.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.14): the stuck-at-1, never-flickering symptom above
// has a much simpler explanation than a wiring/echo issue -- CX-Designer
// momentary bit switches are commonly "host-clear": the panel SETS the
// bit on press and relies on the connected device to clear it back to 0,
// guaranteeing a command isn't missed even under slow host polling. This
// firmware only ever read the buttons, never wrote them back, so the very
// first tap on each would latch it at 1 forever -- exactly what V4.15.12
// showed. serviceHmiButtonPolling() now clears a button's bit back to 0
// (via sendWB) immediately after dispatching its press. The separate
// finding from V4.15.13 (own-WM-traffic bytes bleeding into pending RB
// reads, ~30% of attempts) is still real and still unexplained -- this
// fix addresses why buttons read "always pressed", not why some fraction
// of RB reads fail outright. The raw-bytes-on-success dump added in
// V4.15.13 stays in place to keep validating that the 70% of RB reads
// reported as successful are genuine PT replies.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.15): the V4.15.14 build ran on real hardware, and the
// V4.15.13 raw-success dump paid off immediately -- two genuine, address-
// matched RB replies on real button presses ("ALARM LOG"/"TEST") captured
// as "004B" and "0037" (0x4B, 0x37), not "0000"/"0001". Both happen to be
// odd, both correctly corresponded to a real press, so the intended bit
// lives in the LSB of a word whose other content is unexplained (padding?
// an unrelated upper byte?) -- consumeReadBit() now checks `value & 1`
// instead of `value != 0`, which would have misfired on any nonzero-even
// reply. Separately, RM success crashed to 10/52 (~19%, down from ~91-96%)
// once 200ms button polling started competing for the shared link -- RB
// alone made 216 attempts against RM's 52 in the same window. Buttons are
// occasional/diagnostic; HotMelt Start/End Position feeds real tube-
// tracking logic, so BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS went 200ms->750ms and
// serviceHmiInputPolling() now runs before serviceHmiButtonPolling() each
// loop() tick (reversed from V4.15.12) so positions get first refusal on
// the shared read slot. Also newly observed, once, not yet understood:
// a raw response "[ESC]ER0517" while an RM request was pending -- neither
// our-own-WM-traffic-shaped (that check requires response[1]=='W') nor a
// normal 'R','M'/'B' reply. Could be a genuine PT error/status reply
// (Memory Link protocols often use "ER" for errors) or could be corrupted
// bytes from another overlapping transmission -- one sample isn't enough
// to tell, and no code change follows from it yet. Watch for it recurring.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.16): user confirmed real button presses (ALARM LOG,
// TEST) worked correctly on V4.15.15 -- detected, dispatched, cleared --
// but the lamp never visibly lit on the actual HMI. A CX-Designer
// screenshot of the real TEST button object (PB0088) settled the address
// question for good: Write Address $B33 (matches BUTTON_TEST_ADDR),
// Display Address1 $B43 (matches LAMP_TEST_ADDR exactly), Action Type
// Momentary (confirms the host-clear theory from V4.15.14), button type
// "Select Shape(Type2-1)" -- shape lights purely from Display Address1's
// ON/OFF. So the addressing and architecture were right; the bug was
// applying RB_BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET to WB as well as RB. This is the exact
// asymmetry already known from $W (RM needs the offset, WM does not) --
// V4.15.12 missed applying that same precedent to $B. WB now writes the
// plain address, matching sendWM. If lamps still don't light after this,
// the next suspect is Display Address1 needing an inverted or different
// value convention than a plain 0/1 bit -- but try this first, since it's
// the same fix that was already proven necessary for $W.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.17): V4.15.16 field data still showed a familiar
// failure -- "[ESC]WM001F" bleeding into a pending RM read right after a
// burst of matrix column writes, RM down to 67% and RB to 48% (both worse
// than RM's pre-button ~91-96% baseline). Root cause older than the
// buttons: sendWM()/sendWB() are deliberately non-blocking (no flush(),
// so InspectingTube's Keyence/encoder timing never stalls), so a write's
// bytes can still be physically draining off the wire when a read request
// starts a few loop() iterations later -- and this link has echoed its own
// TX back onto RX since before V4.15.4's original write/read-overlap fix.
// Added NS12Manager::markTxBusy(), called from sendWM()/sendWB(), which
// estimates (from frame byte count and NS12::BAUD) when the just-queued
// send will actually finish draining, accumulating across back-to-back
// sends the way a real UART FIFO would. requestRM()/requestRB() now defer
// (return false, retried on their normal poll schedule) until that
// estimate passes -- entirely non-blocking, so it cannot introduce the
// Keyence 100us-pulse jitter an actual flush() would risk.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.18): V4.15.17 made no difference -- field report
// "HMI buttons do not reach ESP", meaning the failure may be upstream of
// this firmware's NS12 layer entirely (CX-Designer project setting,
// wiring, or the PT genuinely not answering RB), not something more
// non-blocking-read tuning can fix. Added a minimal direct-GPIO proof rig
// (Pins::TEST_GPIO_*, GPIO_BUTTON_PROOF_TEST) -- 2 outputs + 4 inputs,
// entirely bypassing NS12 -- to isolate "does the ESP32 see a physical
// button press at all" from "does the NS12 link carry it." Inputs reuse
// GPIO4/5/6/7 (confirmed OK for now since the real encoder/presence/
// Keyence sensors those pins belong to are not physically wired yet);
// GPIO10-13 (no conflict at all) were the first choice but are hard to
// reach on the actual board. GPIO_BUTTON_PROOF_TEST makes this and the
// real sensor pin setup in setup() mutually exclusive, since both claim
// the same 4 pins -- set it back to 0 once this test is done and the real
// sensors get wired. Not a replacement for the 5 real HMI buttons/lamps.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.19): "Hardwired Done - Final" -- a complete,
// confirmed pin map replacing every remaining PLACEHOLDER pin in this
// file (both the ESP32-direct Pins namespace and the MCP23017 McpPin
// namespace). Changes: KEYENCE_TRIGGER_PIN moved GPIO6->GPIO1; new
// ESP_OPTO_3 (GPIO2) and ESP_INPUT_3 (GPIO6),
// function TBD, wired for I/O testing only (see serviceIoTest() and the
// '1'-'9'/'A'/'K' serial commands); KEYENCE_RESULT_PIN (GPIO7) removed
// entirely -- the field report marks GPIO7 NC, so the direct-GPIO/
// hardware-interrupt Keyence Result mechanism (keyenceResultIsr()) was
// removed. Per the user's explicit choice, Keyence Result moves to the
// MCP23017 (McpPin::INPUT_1 or INPUT_2) -- exact slot not yet decided,
// and this reopens a previously-documented tradeoff: MCP is only polled
// during Standby/TubeGap, never InspectingTube, which was the original
// reason Keyence Result was kept off MCP. Not yet wired into
// keyenceResultPending/Pass -- see that variable's own comment.
//
// GPIO_BUTTON_PROOF_TEST removed entirely (obsolete -- its pins are now
// all claimed by real, final signals). The old McpPin scheme (NORMAL_STOP/
// FAST_STOP/HORN/BEACON/READY/WARNING/ACKNOWLEDGE/RESET/AUTO/
// MACHINE_STOPPED/GLUE_READY) is gone too -- it was a placeholder from
// before any real MCP23017 wiring existed, and none of those names survive
// in the real map (2 status RGB LEDs, 1 spare output, 2 generic inputs, 2
// generic opto outputs). This quietly removed the automatic Standby->
// WaitingForTube transition and the MCP-driven fault path, since both
// depended on AUTO/MACHINE_STOPPED inputs that no longer exist --
// deliberately NOT replaced with a guess at what the 2 real generic MCP
// inputs should mean; Standby now requires an explicit 'W' command until
// that's decided. The field report's own literal pin-index values (e.g.
// "MCP23017_ILED_R = 1" for "GPB0") don't match Adafruit_MCP23X17's actual
// indexing (GPA0-7=0-7, GPB0-7=8-15, this project's own established
// convention from the very scheme just removed) -- corrected using the
// GPA/GPB port+bit each comment names as the source of truth; worth an
// explicit double-check against the board.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.20): key clarification -- "ESP32 is NOT the boss
// here." This board is an "Auto Triggered Sensor" reporting to a Siemens
// S7-315-2 PLC, which actually runs the bottomer. Added PlcComms: PLC_
// STATUS out (STOP/ALARM/WARNING/READY, one of 4 mutually-exclusive
// states, binary-encoded across 3 opto outputs -- McpPin::OPTO_1 (bit 0),
// McpPin::OPTO_2 (bit 1), ESP_OPTO_3 (bit 2/MSB), 3 bits chosen over the
// minimum 2 for headroom beyond today's 4 states) and PLC_CONTROL in
// (ACKNOWLEDGE + MACHINE_RUNNING, 2 independent flags, dedicated bits, no
// encoding needed -- McpPin::INPUT_1/INPUT_2). This reclaims the 2 MCP
// inputs V4.15.19 had tentatively reserved for Keyence Result, so Keyence
// Result moved again -- to ESP_INPUT_3/GPIO6, a direct ESP32 GPIO with a
// real hardware interrupt (keyenceResultIsr(), restored to its original
// pre-V4.15.19 shape). This is a strict improvement over the V4.15.19 MCP
// plan: it eliminates the MCP-polling-latency tradeoff entirely (MCP only
// polls during Standby/TubeGap, never InspectingTube) rather than needing
// a decision on whether that tradeoff was acceptable.
//
// Bit-to-pin assignment, the 4 status codes, and which MCP input is
// ACKNOWLEDGE vs MACHINE_RUNNING are ALL this file's placeholder choices,
// clearly separable in PlcComms::setStatus()/servicePlcControl() -- verify
// against the actual S7-315-2 program before trusting them. Serial
// commands 'P' (cycle PLC_STATUS through all 4 real states) and 'K'
// (manual Keyence trigger pulse) added for bench/PLC-program verification;
// '8'/'9'/'A' still do raw per-bit toggles for electrical checks but are
// transient -- overwritten on the next real state-driven PLC_STATUS
// update. No trigger condition exists yet for ALARM/WARNING specifically
// (this project has no concept of "degraded but not faulted" state) --
// only STOP (FaultStop) and READY (everything else) are automatically
// driven; use 'P' for the other two until a real condition is defined.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.21): field request -- a physical, tangible way to
// confirm an HMI button press actually completes end-to-end (touch -> RB
// read -> dispatch), without needing to watch Serial. SETUP/ALARM LOG/
// TREND FULL's stub handlers (log-only until now) each toggle one channel
// of the internal RGB LED instead: SETUP->ILED_R, ALARM LOG->ILED_G,
// TREND FULL->ILED_B. Exactly 3 stub buttons and 3 LED channels, so the
// mapping is a natural 1:1, not yet confirmed as the intended final
// pairing -- easy to change if a different assignment is wanted. Still no
// real SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL behavior; this is a bench-test aid, not
// a step toward one.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.22): field report on V4.15.21 -- "ILED_G only, no
// control over it" plus "terminal too fast to read". Two fixes:
// (1) NS12_DEBUG_RAW_RX turned back OFF -- RM/RB/WM/WB have all sat at
// 100% success across several diagnostics dumps since V4.15.17-20's fix,
// so this verbose per-byte trace was only burying other Serial output
// (like the HMI button/LED messages the user was trying to read) with no
// remaining diagnostic value. (2) The MCP output toggle (both '1'-'9' and
// the SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL LED handlers) used to compute its next
// state from !mcp.digitalRead(pin) -- reading the MCP23017's GPIO
// register back and inverting it. That register isn't guaranteed to
// track the OLAT/output-latch value actually written; "always lights the
// same channel, never toggles" is exactly what a read-back that returns
// the same value every time would produce. Added a firmware-side
// mcpOutputState[9]/toggleMcpOutput() that tracks each of the 9 real MCP
// outputs' commanded state directly, used by both call sites -- toggling
// is now deterministic regardless of what the MCP or the physical LED
// reports back. If ILED_G (or any channel) still won't respond after
// this, the read-back theory is ruled out and the next suspect is
// physical wiring on that specific channel.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.23): the toggle fix above worked (real per-channel
// LED control confirmed -- "[HMI] TEST button pressed." / "[HMI] ALARM
// LOG button pressed." / "[HMI] ^ toggled ILED G -> ON" all fired
// correctly) but surfaced a more serious finding: those presses happened
// with nobody touching the screen. Genuine phantom presses, not visible
// noise -- RB had been sitting at 100% success with zero parse errors
// across hundreds of reads in every recent diagnostics dump, so a wrong
// address/count match (which would show up as a parse error, not a
// clean success) is not the explanation. Root cause still unknown.
// Mitigated, not fixed: serviceHmiButtonPolling() now requires the SAME
// button to read "pressed" on two CONSECUTIVE polls (pendingButtonRead[])
// before accepting it and dispatching handleHmiButtonPress() -- a single
// sample is no longer trusted on its own. Costs up to one extra ~750ms
// poll cycle of latency for a real press. Also corrected the McpPin
// naming: what V4.15.19/22 called SPARE_7 is actually ELED_Y, a 4th
// (yellow) channel on the external status indicator -- both internal and
// external LEDs are single RGB(+Y for external) LEDs, one color channel
// lit at a time by design, not 3-4 simultaneous channels mixing colors.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.24): field report on V4.15.23 -- ILED_G still turns
// on/off by itself even with the 2-consecutive-read debounce in place.
// This is an important finding, not just "still broken": a single-sample
// glitch is exactly what that debounce should catch, so a phantom
// surviving two confirming polls 750ms apart means the underlying signal
// reads "pressed" consistently for over a second -- a sustained value,
// not electrical noise. That points away from a wiring/collision problem
// and toward $B31 (ALARM LOG) being driven by something in the PT's own
// logic unrelated to touch -- plausible given its name; worth checking in
// CX-Designer whether $B31 is referenced anywhere besides that button
// object (an alarm-summary condition, a macro, etc.), the same way the
// TEST button's screenshot settled an earlier question. Not yet done --
// needs the user to check.
//
// Separately actioned: "use all Internal and External LEDs". The 3 stub
// buttons (SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL) now share one round-robin cycle
// across all 7 real LED channels (ILED_R/G/B + ELED_R/G/B/Y) instead of
// each owning one fixed internal channel -- advanceLedCycle(), one
// channel lit at a time. Incidental benefit: any future phantom press
// from any of the 3 buttons now visibly advances the same shared LED
// instead of only ever toggling ILED_G, making a recurrence obvious at a
// glance regardless of which button's bit is misbehaving.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.25): user confirmed the ALARM LOG phantom "does not
// come from HMI" -- ruling out a PT-side alarm condition and pointing
// squarely at this firmware. Real CX-Designer Address View screenshot of
// the Hot Melt Monitor screen then showed why: "2(P) $W0(W)" at the top --
// a screen-switch object triggered by writing to $W0. TELEMETRY_BASE_ADDR
// had been $W0 since this project's first version, meaning telemetry has
// been writing arbitrary heartbeat/FPS/status values into a page-
// navigation command word every 250ms the entire time. A strong unifying
// explanation for multiple previously-separate symptoms: phantom HMI
// button presses (this firmware's own PLACEHOLDER pin/address guesses
// were never the issue -- $B33(W)/$B43(R1) in the same screenshot matches
// BUTTON_TEST_ADDR/LAMP_TEST_ADDR exactly) and unexpected matrix content
// appearing on 'R' (field report, same session) -- constant bogus page-
// switch attempts could plausibly corrupt the PT's Memory Link state well
// beyond visible screen flicker. Moved TELEMETRY_BASE_ADDR to $W100,
// inside the confirmed-free $W13-$W499 range from the real Symbol Table
// (V4.15.11). The same screenshot also showed a second screen-switch,
// "0(P) $W830(W)" -- not currently written by this file, but worth
// keeping clear of. Root cause not yet proven (needs the fix confirmed on
// hardware), but this is a much better-evidenced explanation than
// anything examined so far, and worth testing before chasing anything
// else.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.26): field question -- "never seen 1 ever, are we
// getting the right address?" on the diagnostics "HMI buttons : 0/0/0/0/0"
// line. Addressing is already confirmed correct (the V4.15.25 screenshot's
// $B33(W)/$B43(R1) matches BUTTON_TEST_ADDR/LAMP_TEST_ADDR exactly) --
// the real explanation is simpler: buttonState[i] is force-cleared back to
// false inside the SAME call that detects a press (so the next press is a
// fresh edge without an extra poll-cycle's wait), so the "confirmed
// pressed" state is only ever true for microseconds. A once-a-second
// diagnostics snapshot landing in that window is practically impossible --
// the line reading all-0 forever was never evidence of a broken read.
// Added buttonPressCount[], a lifetime counter incremented in
// handleHmiButtonPress(), printed alongside the existing instantaneous
// line -- this is the actual way to confirm via the periodic diagnostics
// dump (not just a live Serial line caught at the right instant) that
// presses are registering.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.27): field report -- even after the V4.15.25 $W0 fix,
// ALARM LOG and TEST still fire phantom presses (lifetime counters 6 and 5
// with nobody touching the screen) while genuine touches on ANY of the 5
// buttons register zero. That combination retroactively casts doubt on the
// V4.15.15 fix this file has relied on since: `value & 1` (LSB) was derived
// from exactly two captured samples (0x4B, 0x37) that were simply assumed to
// be genuine presses because they were nonzero -- if either was itself a
// phantom/garbage read, the whole LSB theory rests on no confirmed-good
// data at all. Rather than propose a fourth bit-position guess blind,
// NS12Manager::consumeReadBit() now also returns the complete raw word
// (lastReadWordValue, unmasked) via a new rawValueOut parameter, and
// serviceHmiButtonPolling() logs it unconditionally as "[HMI-RAW] <name>
// $Bxx raw=0x.... bit0=.." on every poll of every button. This is
// diagnostic-only -- no behavior change to press detection/dispatch --
// meant to produce one unambiguous, timestamped trace of raw values while a
// button is deliberately held pressed vs. deliberately left untouched, so
// the actual bit (or non-bit -- possibly a value that only settles after
// several polls, or an address that isn't independent at all) can be read
// off real evidence instead of guessed again.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.28): the V4.15.27 raw-word capture came back with
// nobody touching the screen: $B34(DIAG)=0x38, $B33(TEST)=0x37,
// $B32(TREND FULL)=0x36, $B30(SETUP)=0x4A. Three of the four move in exact
// lockstep with their own requested address ($B32/$B33/$B34 -> raw =
// address+22, precisely) -- a real boolean bit can never track the address
// it was read from like that. This points at the response FRAME itself,
// not the final integer: either the wrong one of parseReadResponse()'s two
// candidateOffsets (3 or 4) is validating by coincidence, or the PT's RB
// data field is wider than the single "0"/"1" character this code has
// always assumed, and bytes belonging to the address/count fields (or a
// neighboring frame) are bleeding into what gets stored as the button's
// value. dumpRejectedLine() already prints raw bytes on a parse FAILURE,
// but these RB reads are structurally succeeding (addr+count match), so
// that path never fires -- there was no visibility into a "successful"
// frame's actual content. Added an unconditional (not gated by
// NS12_DEBUG_RAW_RX) per-successful-RB-poll dump logging the matched
// offset plus the literal addrText/countText/dataText substrings and raw
// line bytes, so the next capture shows the real wire frame instead of
// only its (apparently untrustworthy) parsed value.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.29): the V4.15.28 raw-frame dump confirmed the data
// field is a genuine 4-hex-digit WORD (e.g. "ESC RB401F01004B", dataText=
// "004B") -- structurally identical to an RM response, not the single "0"/
// "1" character this code assumed since V4.15.12. Address math still
// checks out (401F = 31+16384 for ALARM LOG). A controlled hold test on
// SETUP ($B30) then came back ambiguous: dataText stayed "004A" every time
// it was sampled, but at BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=750ms round-robin across 5
// buttons, any one button is only actually queried once every ~3.75s --
// a 2-3s hold can easily complete without a single read ever landing
// during the touch. That result cannot distinguish "no bit lives in this
// word" from "we just didn't sample it while pressed". Added an 'H' serial
// command: burst-probe mode polls all 5 buttons back-to-back (bounded only
// by the link's own turnaround, not the 750ms cadence) for
// BURST_PROBE_DURATION_MS, guaranteeing several samples land during even a
// short real hold. Diagnostic-only, self-reverting after the duration --
// no change to normal-mode polling cadence or press dispatch.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.30): the V4.15.29 burst probe returned a very clean
// answer -- across dozens of rapid-fire samples spanning real button
// presses, every address held its exact value with zero variation:
// $B30=004A, $B31=004B, $B32=0036, $B33=0037, $B34=0038, every single time.
// That's not noise and it's not a live bit -- it's static content that
// never once responded to a genuine touch. RB_BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET reuses the
// identical constant (16384/0x4000) already confirmed correct for RM's $W
// (word) reads. If that value is actually this PT's *word*-area code
// rather than an offset specific to bit reads, RB($B30..34) would be
// silently landing on $W30..$W34 instead -- real, valid memory (hence no
// timeouts), inside the "$W13-$W499 confirmed free" range from the real
// Symbol Table (explaining the static, unrelated-looking content), but
// never the true $B bit area at all. Added a 'V' serial command: reads
// $W30..$W34 via the independently-confirmed-correct RM path and prints
// each for direct comparison against RB's values. An exact match proves
// RB has been reading word memory all along, not bit memory -- the real
// bug would then be the offset (or the RB command's address encoding
// entirely), never the `& 1` bit-position extraction this file spent
// V4.15.15-27 tuning on data that was never a real bit to begin with.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.31): got the actual manual (Cat. No. V085-E1-07) --
// the V4.15.30 word-vs-bit question turned out moot, because the real bug
// was one level lower, in parseReadResponse() itself, affecting RM and RB
// alike. The manual documents SUM as *always* appended by the PT to every
// response ("Be sure that it is added when PT is transmitting"), fully
// independent of the HOST's own *S=SUM-off setting used in outgoing
// commands -- this code had only ever considered *S from OUR side, and
// treated the PT's trailing 2-hex-digit checksum as if it were part of
// *D. Proof, not another guess: computed SUM (lower byte of the sum of
// every byte from ESC through *D) for all 5 real RB frames captured in
// the field (e.g. "RB401F0100" + SUM "4B" for ALARM LOG) and got an exact
// match against the "4B"/"36"/"4A"/"37"/"38" this code had been reading as
// the button's value, for every single one. The real *D in all 5 was "00"
// (OFF) -- every "phantom press" was this code checking the checksum byte,
// not the button; V4.15.15's `& 1` theory was built on 2 samples that were
// never real button data at all. The manual's own worked example also
// shows the true bit lives at bit 7 (MSB) of *D's first byte for a 1-bit
// read, not bit 0. parseReadResponse() now strips and validates SUM
// (rejecting a frame whose checksum doesn't match -- a real integrity
// check this link never had before), and consumeReadBit() now checks
// 0x80. This is the actual fix, not another diagnostic build -- next real
// hardware run should show clean 0x00/0x80 button reads and genuine
// presses finally registering.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.32): the checksum fix held up under exhaustive
// real-hardware retesting -- hundreds of burst-probe RB samples, all
// checksum-valid, all genuinely 0x00 -- but genuine touchscreen presses
// still never flip bit7, even after the CX-Designer switch type was
// changed from Momentary to Alternate/SET and re-downloaded to the panel.
// One field report of "$B30 shows ON on the HMI" turned out to be the
// LAMP indicator ($B40, a separate address this firmware itself writes
// via setActiveLamp()/sendWB() -- see that function), not live proof of a
// touch reaching $B30; it was very likely left lit by an earlier
// pre-checksum-fix phantom detection and never confirms anything about
// the touch itself. Separately, a third-party suggestion proposing an
// unsolicited WM-bitmask notify scheme was checked against the real
// manual and rejected: it misstated the *S SET/OR encoding (manual: 1=SET,
// not OR) and proposed reverting ESC/baud/pins to values already disproven
// on this exact unit (0x1C, 38400, GPIO16/17) -- not used here. The
// manual's real SM/SB/SD/SH change-notice commands do exist, but are
// gated by a PT-side "Notice Start $B" threshold that only affects
// unsolicited notify, not our direct RB reads -- irrelevant to why RB
// reads 0.
//
// To isolate the remaining question -- is $B30 ever genuinely written by
// anything, or is there still a firmware bug in the write path nobody has
// tested -- added a 'J' serial command: writes 1 to $B30 via sendWB()
// OURSELVES (no touchscreen involved at all) and bursts RB reads of it.
// If it reads back bit7=1, sendWB()/requestRB()/parseReadResponse() are
// proven correct end to end and the touch not reaching $B30 is
// conclusively a CX-Designer/PT-side configuration issue. If even our own
// write doesn't read back, that points at a real bug in sendWB()'s *D
// encoding -- the manual describes WB's *D as 4-bits-per-hex-digit,
// MSB-first (same convention RB's fix uncovered for reads), which this
// code's literal '0'/'1'-per-bit encoding (unchanged since V4.15.12) has
// never been checked against.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.33): the 'J' test came back conclusive -- writing
// count=1, bits[0]=true to $B30 with the OLD encoding (literal ASCII "1")
// read back as 0x00 via a checksum-validated RB, on our OWN write with no
// touchscreen involved at all. That rules out "CX-Designer config only"
// as the sole explanation: a real bug existed in sendWB() itself, and had
// been there since V4.15.12. Fixed to match the manual's documented WB
// *D encoding: 4 bits packed per hex digit, MSB-first ("fills data in
// descending order starting with first digit") -- the same convention
// that turned out to be the real RB fix, just for the write side.
// bits[0]=true for a 1-bit write now encodes as hex digit "8" (binary
// 1000, the requested bit in the nibble's MSB position), not "1". A
// "false" write encodes as "0" either way, which is exactly why the
// host-clear-to-0 path (every prior press-detection cycle) never showed
// a symptom while every write of an ON bit -- lamps, and this test --
// was silently malformed the whole time. Multi-bit writes (the 5-bit
// lamp array) now pack into ceil(count/4) hex digits per the same rule,
// instead of comma-separated literal characters. Send 'J' again on this
// build: if $B30 finally reads back bit7=1, this was the fix.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.34): the V4.15.33 WB encoding fix was real (the
// literal-'1' bug is gone) but 'J' still reads back bit7=0 via the
// OFFSET-based RB address -- yet the user directly watched SETUP turn ON
// on the physical screen the instant 'J' was sent. That combination is
// the real finding here: our own write demonstrably reached the PT's
// live, rendered memory, but the offset address RB has always read from
// (startAddr + RB_BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET = +16384) apparently is NOT the same
// physical bit sendWB()'s plain address writes to. On reflection,
// RB_BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET's entire "confirmation" history amounts to: (a)
// producing structurally valid, checksummed responses -- true of ANY
// valid address in range, never proof it's the CORRECT one -- and (b) one
// coincidence (the "33/34mm" position values that V4.15.31 proved were
// actually checksum bytes, not real word data). Neither actually verifies
// +16384 reads the logical object CX-Designer calls "$B30". Added an 'N'
// serial command: writes 1 to $B30 (same as 'J'), then reads it back
// using the exact same PLAIN address sendWB() already writes to --
// bypassing RB_BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET entirely -- to test directly whether
// reads need the same unoffset address writes do.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.35): the 'N' test came back conclusive and clean --
// "[ESC]RB001E01804E": addrText="001E" (30 decimal, the plain address,
// exactly as predicted), dataText="80" (bit7=1, real nonzero data), sum
// valid. The very next line, same instant, same button, OFFSET address:
// dataText="00". Two reads of "the same $B30", one showing the write and
// one not, settles it -- RB_BIT_ADDRESS_OFFSET was never the right
// address for bit reads. requestRB() now uses the plain address
// unconditionally (matching sendWB(), which has been right since
// V4.15.16), and consumeReadBit() no longer subtracts the offset when
// reporting addrOut. This is the real fix for the entire "buttons never
// register" saga -- RM, RB, WM, and WB all agree now: $W needs +16384 for
// reads only; $B needs no offset at all, for reads or writes. Next real
// hardware run should finally show genuine touchscreen presses flipping
// bit7 during serviceHmiButtonPolling()'s normal round-robin, no burst
// mode or manual WB test required.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.36): buttons fully confirmed working on real
// hardware with SETUP reverted to Momentary (the switch-type experiment
// is no longer needed -- host-clear already handles Momentary/Alternate/
// SET alike). Next field report: "$B40 doesn't toggle" -- the lamp write
// (setActiveLamp() -> sendWB(kLampAddrs[0], lamps, 5)) packs 5 bits into
// 2 hex digits, a case the V4.15.33 encoding fix was never independently
// verified against (only the single-bit $B30 write was, via 'J'/'N').
// sendWB() is fire-and-forget with no response, so there was no way to
// inspect what it actually put on the wire short of the full
// NS12_DEBUG_RAW_RX firehose. Added an unconditional per-send print
// (mirroring RB's [NS12-FRAME]) instead of gating this evidence behind a
// flag or guessing at the multi-bit packing again -- next lamp write will
// show the real addr/count/raw bytes directly.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.37): the V4.15.36 [NS12-WB-TX] print confirmed the
// lamp write encoding is correct (addr=0x28, *D="80" for "SETUP lamp ON,
// others off" -- exactly right per the packing rules), so no fix was
// needed there. Separate field question: "why 6 sec to get a toggle?"
// Two costs were stacking: the 5-button round-robin (750ms each = 3.75s
// worst case to poll any one button) and the V4.15.23 2-consecutive-
// reads debounce on top of it (up to one more full cycle, ~7.5s worst
// case combined). That debounce was a mitigation for the checksum bug
// (V4.15.31) and RB offset bug (V4.15.35), both since fixed and hardware-
// confirmed clean -- checksum validation in parseReadResponse() already
// rejects a genuinely corrupted frame outright, a stronger guarantee than
// "wait for two reads to agree" ever was. Removed pendingButtonRead[] and
// the debounce entirely; a single checksum-valid read is now trusted
// directly, roughly halving worst-case detection latency to the
// round-robin's own ~3.75s. BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS (750ms, chosen in
// V4.15.15 to stop RM position polling from starving) is untouched here
// -- a further latency win, but a separate, riskier change to verify
// against RM success rate before making.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.38): "we'll do toggle in HMI" -- the switches moved
// from Momentary to native panel-side Alternate, since ESP32-side
// detection latency (~3.75s worst case, per V4.15.37) is too slow for a
// status lamp that needs to react the instant a finger lands. Field
// pushback on the follow-up plan ("what good is a status lamp if it can't
// show absolute reality") was correct: this file's own setActiveLamp()
// (one WB-driven lamp for "whoever was pressed most recently") was never
// a real-state indicator, only an approximation, and the host-clear-to-0
// write on $B30-$B34 was actively WRONG for Alternate switches --
// forcing the panel's own toggle bit back off immediately after every
// press it was supposed to own. Both removed. $B30-$B34 are now pure
// read-only reflections of each switch's real, panel-owned state;
// buttonState[] mirrors that live and unconditionally (no more force-
// clearing), so the diagnostics "instantaneous" line is finally
// meaningful too, not just the lifetime counters. handleHmiButtonPress()
// still fires once per rising edge for its one-shot actions (LED cycle/
// test pattern/diagnostics) -- only the writing back stops.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.39): "clean the terminal and show which function is
// on" -- the per-poll debug prints ([NS12-FRAME] for every RM/RB read,
// [HMI-RAW] for every button poll, [NS12-WB-TX] for every WB send) were
// all made unconditional at various points during the checksum/offset/
// encoding investigation, specifically so real evidence couldn't be
// missed. That investigation is done and every fix confirmed on hardware,
// so all three are re-gated behind NS12_DEBUG_RAW_RX (default off) --
// they remain available by flipping that one flag if this link ever needs
// re-diagnosing. A redundant, already-gated duplicate of [NS12-FRAME]
// (V4.15.13, never removed when V4.15.28 superseded it) is deleted rather
// than also gated. In their place: a new unconditional "[SWITCH] <name>
// -> ON/OFF" line, printed only when a switch's real state actually
// changes -- the clean, at-a-glance "which function is on" the terminal
// was missing. The existing periodic diagnostics dump's "instantaneous"
// line (now genuinely live, per V4.15.38) still gives the full snapshot
// on demand.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.40): "need 5 different led as status" -- each of
// the 5 HMI switches now has its own dedicated physical LED (ILED_R/G/B,
// ELED_R/G for SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL/TEST/DIAG respectively), lit
// exactly when that switch is really on and off exactly when it's really
// off. Replaces advanceLedCycle(), which only ever showed "whoever was
// pressed most recently" cycling through one shared LED -- never a real
// per-switch indicator, same category of problem as the removed
// ESP32-driven lamp write (V4.15.38). setButtonStatusLed() is called from
// serviceHmiButtonPolling() on every real state change (both edges), not
// from handleHmiButtonPress() (rising-edge-only, one-shot dispatch) --
// a status LED has to track the switch turning off too. TEST and DIAG
// keep their existing one-shot actions (test pattern / diagnostics
// print) in addition to their own dedicated status LED; SETUP/ALARM LOG/
// TREND FULL still have no other defined action, same as before.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.41): field report -- even with the dedicated status
// LEDs and the V4.15.37 debounce removal, still "3-5 sec to react", which
// is consistent with (not a new bug beyond) BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS=750ms
// x 5 buttons = 3.75s worst-case round-robin. Lowered to 250ms as a
// verify-first step -- see BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS's own comment for why
// not the original 200ms (that specific value has a documented real-
// hardware failure from V4.15.15, predating markTxBusy() and the
// checksum/offset fixes) and why 250ms is now plausibly safe (burst mode
// already polls all 5 buttons far faster than 200ms with zero anomalies
// across hundreds of samples). Needs confirmation: watch NS12 RM/RB
// success rates in the next diagnostics dump for any regression before
// going lower.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.42): raised NS12::BAUD 9600 -> 38400 at the operator's
// request, on record that the earlier 9600 choice traces to a documented
// ~15% RM timeout rate at 38400 in the original bench testing (see the
// MERGE NOTE above) -- this reverses that call, not repeats it blind.
// Requires the matching change on the panel side (CX-Designer Communication
// Settings for the port driving Memory Link, redownloaded to the PT) before
// this link will work at all; the two sides do not auto-negotiate. Watch
// the next diagnostics dump's RM/RB success rates for a return of the old
// timeout pattern -- markTxBusy()'s per-frame timing estimate scales with
// NS12::BAUD automatically, so no other constant needs to move with it.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.43): "reset the other button on a new push" -- the 5
// SETUP/ALARM LOG/TREND FULL/TEST/DIAG switches are mutually-exclusive
// screen/function selectors, but native panel-side Alternate toggling
// (V4.15.38) only guarantees each switch reflects ITS OWN real state; it
// has no notion of the other 4, so more than one could stay lit at once
// once switches are pressed out of order. serviceHmiButtonPolling() now
// WB-clears every OTHER switch that's currently on at the moment a new one
// is detected going ON, restoring one-active-at-a-time. This does not
// revive the V4.15.38 host-clear-to-0 pattern the operator objected to --
// that used to fight a switch's own bit right after ITS OWN press; this
// only ever writes a DIFFERENT switch's bit, and only the one the panel's
// own screen-selection logic didn't already turn off itself, so each
// switch's own toggle is still the sole authority on its own state.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.44): encoder now wired to a real ZATOR LMZ02 --
// printDiagnostics() ('D') gains an "Encoder count" line (raw PCNT total
// and the ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_MM-derived mm figure) so it's actually
// visible over serial; encoder.total() was only ever consumed internally
// (forward-projection math) before this. ENCODER_COUNTS_PER_MM is still
// the placeholder 1.0 from Action Item 3 (real pulses-per-mm unconfirmed
// for this encoder) -- use the raw count to derive it: move the tube a
// known distance and divide counts by mm.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.45): real per-tube QC (CaptureController) only ever
// evaluates once per tube, gated by a raw-delta threshold crossing --
// correct for production but no good for bench testing without a tube
// actually moving through. New 'L' serial command toggles a continuous
// bench-test print (independent of CaptureController/presence/encoder
// entirely): once a raw baseline is captured ('B'), it prints the live
// per-frame min/max/avg raw delta at a steady rate for as long as it's on.
// Reuses minimumTemperatureC/maximumTemperatureC/averageTemperatureC,
// which calculateFrameStatistics() already recomputes fresh every
// successful frame -- no new acquisition or averaging logic needed, just
// a rate-limited print toggle.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.46): first real 'L' bench data (bare hand in front
// of the camera, room-temp baseline) -- ambient noise floor sits around
// +/-20 raw delta, hand peaks observed 50-84. CAPTURE_TRIGGER_RAW_DELTA
// was still its blind PLACEHOLDER (300) -- far above anything a hand can
// produce, so Strip1/2 never latched present regardless of MATRIX_TEMP_*_C
// (a dead constant, unused by this live raw-delta path -- see its own
// comment; editing it has zero effect on capture behavior). Lowered to 40
// (about 2x the noise floor, comfortably under the observed hand peaks) so
// a hand-heat bench test can actually trigger a capture. MATRIX_RAW_DELTA_MAX
// lowered 1000 -> 150 to match: at 1000, an 84-count hand signal barely
// registers on the HMI palette at all. Both are still placeholders in the
// sense the comment above describes -- informed by a hand now, not hot-melt
// glue, which will run far hotter -- so CAPTURE_TRIGGER_RAW_DELTA in
// particular likely needs to go back up once real glue-temperature data
// exists, or a hand near the lens could false-trigger a real inspection.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.47): real crash -- 'M' (and the HMI TEST button, same
// code path) reliably hit "Guru Meditation Error ... Stack canary watchpoint
// triggered (loopTask)" inside pushWordLampMatrix(), backtrace confirmed via
// esp32_exception_decoder: pushWordLampMatrix() <- pushTestPattern() <-
// handleSerialCommand() <- loop() <- loopTask. Root cause: pushTestPattern()'s
// local testPattern[32*24] (3072 bytes) plus pushWordLampMatrix()'s local
// words[32*24] (1536 bytes) -- ~4.6KB stacked in one call chain on top of
// whatever loop() had already used -- overran loopTask's stack. This
// function already made displayBuf static for exactly this reason; the
// other two arrays were simply missed. Both moved to static storage here,
// same justification: pushWordLampMatrix() is only ever called synchronously
// from loop() (never reentrant, no ISR context), so a static buffer is safe
// and this is a straight stack-to-.bss move, no logic change.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.48): added SB ($B change notice) support -- the
// manual documents this as an unsolicited frame the PT sends on its own
// whenever a $B bit at or above "Notice start $B" (CX-Designer Comm
// Settings, default 16384) changes; no host request needed. Requires
// lowering Notice start $B on the panel (e.g. to 0) and redownloading --
// left at the default, $B30-$B34 are below the threshold and nothing will
// ever be sent; the round-robin poll below is deliberately left at its
// existing 250ms interval as a safety net until real SB traffic is
// confirmed (new diagnostics line: "NS12 SB notify count/rejected").
// Needed a real rework, not just a new parser: every requestRM()/
// requestRB() purged the RX buffer before sending (clearRxBuffer(), to
// drop leaked WM/WB echo bytes) and pollPendingRead() only ever drained
// Serial2 while a read was pending -- either one would have silently
// eaten a notify arriving between polls. Both are now notify-aware:
// pollPendingRead() (renamed pollIncoming()) runs every service() tick
// regardless of pendingness, and the pre-request purge (renamed
// purgeRxBeforeRequest()) processes any complete queued line (SB
// included) instead of blindly discarding it, only dropping a genuinely
// incomplete trailing partial. Once a button's SB traffic is confirmed
// live, BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS can be relaxed further -- left alone this
// version since notify itself is the untested part.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.49): SB notify confirmed live on real hardware --
// field report "Instantly turn on the leds", i.e. sub-poll-interval
// response, only explainable by the notify path (a 250ms round-robin
// alone can't be instant). BUTTON_POLL_INTERVAL_MS relaxed 250ms ->
// 2000ms now that it's just the safety-net resync it was always meant to
// become, not the primary responsiveness path -- see this function's
// FIELD UPDATE above. Real-time detection is now however fast the panel
// itself sends SB, not this constant.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.50): dedicated diagnostic-screen buttons -- one per
// serial command (S/W/I/G/F/1-9/A/K/P/M/C/B/X/R/D/H/V/J/N/L, 28 total),
// each its own new $B bit at NS12::DIAG_BUTTON_BASE_ADDR ($B50) and up,
// contiguous. Reuses handleSerialCommand() directly (each button's rising
// edge just calls it with that command's char) rather than reimplementing
// 28 action branches -- same NS12 read/notify plumbing as the 5 main
// buttons (applyDiagButtonUpdate(), its own round-robin safety-net
// cursor), but no LED, no mutual exclusion: these are independent
// one-shot triggers, not the modal screen-selector buttons are. PLACEHOLDER
// addresses, same caveat as LAMP_SETUP_ADDR etc: not confirmed against a
// real CX-Designer Symbol Table -- build the matching screen with these
// exact addresses (Alternate switch type, same as the 5 main buttons)
// before this does anything. CAUTION: this exposes real state-machine
// overrides (S/W/I/G/F, including FaultStop) and a Keyence trigger pulse
// (K) to a touchscreen tap -- consider a password-protected CX-Designer
// screen for this rather than one reachable during normal operation.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.51): "since we don't use the Celsius decoder, and
// the MLX has a max rate of 64/sec, could we get faster scans?" -- two
// separate facts were being conflated. 64Hz was already tried (see the
// MLX90640 section's own header comment) and confirmed to fail with
// error -8, an I2C bandwidth wall at 800kHz (64Hz needs ~196KB/s vs
// ~100KB/s usable), not a decode-cost problem -- raw-delta already
// skipped the Celsius calibration (V4.15.3) specifically to keep CPU cost
// off the critical path, so there was nothing left to "not decode" for a
// speed gain. The real headroom was elsewhere: MLX_REFRESH_RATE_NOMINAL
// already configures the sensor itself for a confirmed-stable 32Hz, but
// MLX_MEASURED_FPS (the constant that paces how often THIS CODE asks for
// a frame) was still 8.0f -- a conservative guess from early on, per its
// own comment "a fixed assumption, not a live measurement," never
// revisited once the raw-delta path made the CPU side cheap. Raised to
// 32.0f to actually use the sensor's already-proven rate instead of
// asking for 1 in every 4 frames it can deliver. getRawFrame() blocks
// until new subpage data is ready, so this can't return duplicate/stale
// frames -- but polling this close to the sensor's real cadence means
// that block can now occasionally take real time instead of always
// returning instantly (previously guaranteed since 125ms >> 31ms).
// Needs field verification: watch Measured FPS (should climb toward
// ~32) and, more importantly, that Keyence trigger timing and encoder
// counting (both explicitly hard-real-time, sharing this same loop())
// show no new jitter.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.52): root-caused the ~15.6Hz ceiling from V4.15.51
// (requested 32Hz, real Measured FPS landed at 15.59-15.60, repeatably).
// Not a bus-contention or software throttle -- read the vendored driver
// (lib/Adafruit_MLX90640/utility/MLX90640_API.cpp,
// MLX90640_GetFrameData()): getRawFrame() calls it TWICE per call, once
// per subpage, each busy-waiting on the sensor's own "data ready" status
// bit first. MLX_REFRESH_RATE_NOMINAL (MLX90640_32_HZ) governs how fast
// EACH SUBPAGE refreshes, not a full two-subpage frame -- and this code's
// chessboard combine (readMlxRawCombined()) needs a fresh copy of BOTH
// subpages every call. So the real full-frame ceiling is HALF the
// configured refresh rate: 32Hz setting -> ~16Hz full frames, matching
// the measured 15.59-15.60 almost exactly (the small gap is real I2C/
// status-polling overhead). No further gain available without either (a)
// raising MLX_REFRESH_RATE_NOMINAL itself -- already tried at 64Hz,
// already fails with I2C error -8 (see this section's own comment,
// unchanged) -- or (b) a genuinely different acquisition scheme (e.g.
// consuming one freshly-ready subpage per loop() iteration instead of
// blocking for both), which trades staleness/complexity for a rate this
// scheme structurally cannot reach. 15.6Hz is the real ceiling for a
// combined dual-subpage frame at the current, confirmed-stable refresh
// setting -- not a bug, not further tunable from here.
//
// FIELD UPDATE (V4.15.53): operator plans to add a $W50 write to every
// CX-Designer screen (a macro/PT-status object writing that screen's own
// number), so the host can know which screen is currently showing.
// Track-only for now, per explicit choice: RM-polled into
// currentScreenNumber and printed in diagnostics, no firmware behavior
// depends on it yet. A natural next step once real screen numbers exist
// (raised, not built, this version): gate the diagnostic screen's 28
// buttons ($B50-77) on currentScreenNumber actually matching that
// screen, as a real defense against an accidental tap reaching
// FaultStop/state overrides from elsewhere -- see V4.15.50's FIELD
// UPDATE for that same caution. $W50 needs the panel-side write added in
// CX-Designer before this reports anything real; until then it just
// reads back whatever $W50 currently holds (likely 0/unset).
//
// Industrial QC system detecting hot-melt glue application on tubes moving
// at high speed. Confirms glue presence, temperature, and quantity across
// both glue strips per tube pass, and pushes a stable QC-confirmation image
// to an operator HMI (Omron NS12).
//
// Division of responsibility:
//   - Keyence IV2-G30/G300CA owns hot-melt trace start/end pass/fail. ESP32
//     fires a trigger pulse; Keyence returns a result pulse. It does not
//     detect tube boundaries.
//   - MLX90640 owns strip presence, temperature and quantity (3-4 tube
//     sample window acceptable).
//   - Encoder (single-channel pulse train, no direction) gives real tube
//     position/length, used to project forward and fire triggers at
//     adjustable lead distances ahead of the MLX90640 and Keyence stations.
//   - Tube presence sensor gives the ground-truth leading/trailing edges
//     that projection is anchored to.

// '1' 'F'` (7 bytes) every single time. This is NOT shaped like an RM
// response at all -- it starts with 'W','M' (our own WM-write command
// signature), not 'R','M', so parseRmResponse() rejects it on its very
// first check, before either candidate offset is even tried. The offset
// guess was never the actual bug. What's arriving on RX while we wait for

// exceptions, never a malformed reply once the write/read overlap bug
// was fixed). That fits better than the "Response=OFF" theory this

// COULD NOT VERIFY against the official Host Connection Manual (Cat. No.

//
// CONFIRMED (V4.15.11) by an actual hardware test, which is a better

// offset theory is correct for this PT/project. Whether WM also needs it
// has not been tested (see the RM-only rationale below) and should stay
// that way unless WM traffic itself shows a problem.
//
// RM-only, deliberately NOT applied to WM (see sendWM): WM writes already

  // already-working to protect by leaving it unoffset -- unlike sendWM.
  // That missed the precedent sitting right next to it: RM needs the $W
  // offset but WM does not. Real hardware confirmed the same asymmetry for
  // bits -- a confirmed CX-Designer button (Write $B33 / Display Address1
  // $B43, "TEST", Momentary) showed zero visible lamp change while WB was
  // writing to the offset address (0x4028). WB now writes the plain
  // address, matching sendWM.
  //
  // CORRECTED (V4.15.32): *D was being sent as one literal ASCII '0'/'1'
  // character per bit, comma-separated -- mimicking WM's per-value comma
  // format, never checked against the manual. The manual documents WB's
  // *D as PACKED: 4 bits per hex digit, MSB-first ("fills data in
  // descending order starting with first digit"), no commas -- the same
  // MSB-first convention RB's own fix (V4.15.31) proved correct for reads.
  // Proof this mattered: the V4.15.32 'J' self-test (writing count=1,
  // bits[0]=true with the OLD encoding -- literal "1") read back as 0x00
  // via a checksum-validated RB, on OUR OWN write with no touchscreen
  // involved at all -- meaning a "true" bit was never actually reaching
  // the PT's real memory in a form RB could see. A "false" bit happened to
  // encode identically under both schemes ("0" either way), which is
  // exactly why the host-clear-to-0 writes never showed a symptom while
  // every write of an ON bit (lamps, this test) was silently wrong. Now

  // V4.15.31: SUM added to this comment and this method after getting the
  // actual manual (Cat. No. V085-E1-07) text. It documents SUM as *always*
  // appended by the PT to every response ("Be sure that it is added when PT
  // is transmitting"), independent of whatever *S the HOST used in its own
  // request -- this code's *S='0' only omits OUR outgoing checksum, never
  // the PT's. This method had been treating those trailing 2 SUM chars as
  // part of *D the whole time. Proof, not guesswork: computing SUM (lower
  // byte of the sum of every byte from ESC through *D) for all 5 real RB
  // frames captured in the field --
  //   RB401F01[00]4B (ALARM LOG), RB402001[00]36 (TREND FULL),
  //   RB401E01[00]4A (SETUP), RB402101[00]37 (TEST), RB402201[00]38 (DIAG)
  // -- gives 4B/36/4A/37/38 in every single case, an exact match with what
  // this code had been misreading as "the button's value". The real *D in
  // all 5 was "00" (OFF) -- every "phantom press" (ALARM LOG/TEST reading
  // bit0=1) was this code checking a byte that was actually the checksum,
  // not the button. The manual also documents the true bit-packing (RB:
  // "Read PT memory ($B)"): *D holds ceil(count/8) bytes, and the FIRST
  // requested bit lands at bit 7 (MSB) of the first byte, not bit 0 --
  // worked example: "$B10 11 12 13 14 15 * * -> 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 -> AC"

// unconditionally read every poll rather than reset by our own writes.
// handleHmiButtonPress() still fires once per rising edge (0->1) for its
